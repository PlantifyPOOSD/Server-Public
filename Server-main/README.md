# Server

This file contains the Typescript code that runs out API through Firebase Functions.

You can find the function codes on the SRC folder and Index.ts.

This contains all the API calls code.

This is not ran on any server, this is ran directly through firebase functions. Meaning this API is a serverless API. The only purpose of it being here on GitHub is for understanding purposes.
